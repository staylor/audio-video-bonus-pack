Audio/Video Bonus Pack
======================

Audio/Video extras not found in WordPress core.

Features to be implemented:

1. Automatically encode uploads into all HTML5 formats.  
2. Alternate playlist styles.
3. TBD

There are files of all types in the `files` folder.

Small files work great so far... large files are dying occasionally.

You must have `ffmpeg` installed for this plugin to be useful.

The automatic transcoding works, but this plugin remains experimental for now.

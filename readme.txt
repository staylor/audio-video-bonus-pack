Audio/Video extras not found in WordPress core.

== Description ==

Audio/Video extras not found in WordPress core.

Features to be implemented:

1. Automatically encode uploads into all HTML5 formats. [Done]
1. Create MCE Views for the `[embed]` shortcode. [Done - Now in core, no longer in plugin]
1. Alternate playlist styles.
1. A modal manager for SoundCloud

There are files of all types in the `files` folder.

You must have `ffmpeg` installed for this plugin (transcoding) to be useful.

The automatic transcoding works, but this plugin remains experimental for now.
